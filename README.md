# GameLib
## Project Milestone for The Django for Everybody course

This project is a student development pratice for the Project Milestone.

The Gamelib is a simple django application where users will be able to see games filtered by released plattaforms and inside each game detail there will be a comment space
where they will be able to leave comments about the game. And, maybe, give it a rate.
